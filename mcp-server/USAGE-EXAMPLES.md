```
Ask Beta to review this authentication function for security issues:

function login(username, password) {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`;
  const user = db.execute(query);
  
  if (user && user.password === password) {
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, 'secret123');
    return { success: true, token };
  }
  
  return { success: false };
}
```

**Claude's Action:**
- Calls `sanctuary_beta_analyze` with the code and security context

**Beta's Response (via MCP):**
```
🔧 Beta Clone - Security Analysis

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED:

1. SQL Injection (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - Line: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`
   - Risk: Attacker can inject SQL commands
   - Exploitation: username = "admin' OR '1'='1" bypasses authentication
   - Remediation: Use parameterized queries
   
   Fixed version:
   const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?';
   const user = db.execute(query, [username]);

2. Plaintext Password Comparison (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - Line: `user.password === password`
   - Risk: Passwords stored in plaintext
   - Remediation: Use bcrypt for password hashing
   
   Fixed version:
   const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);

3. Hardcoded JWT Secret (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
   - Line: `jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, 'secret123')`
   - Risk: Predictable secret enables token forgery
   - Remediation: Use environment variable for secret
   
   Fixed version:
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

4. Missing Input Validation (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
   - No validation on username/password inputs
   - Remediation: Add input sanitization and length checks

OVERALL SECURITY RATING: CRITICAL - Do not deploy to production

   Quick fix:
   ```nginx
   ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
   add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
   ```

2. Logging Practices (CRITICAL)
   - Verify no full card numbers in logs
   - Mask sensitive data in error messages
   - Audit logging for access to card data
   
   Implementation:
   ```javascript
   logger.info('Payment processed', {
     cardLast4: payment.cardLast4,
     amount: payment.amount,
     // NEVER log: payment.cardNumber
   });
   ```

3. Access Controls (REQUIRED)
   - Restrict access to payment module
   - Implement role-based access (RBAC)
   - Multi-factor authentication for admins
   
4. Vulnerability Scanning (REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 1)
   - Quarterly ASV scans

## 🎯 **Tips for Effective Usage**

### **Use Natural Language**
You don't need to specify tool names. Just ask naturally:
- ❌ "Call sanctuary_beta_analyze with..."
- ✅ "Ask Beta to analyze this code for bugs"

### **Provide Context**
The more context you provide, the better the response:
- ❌ "Design an API"
- ✅ "Design a REST API for a mobile banking app, needs to support 50k users, budget-conscious"

### **Use Session IDs for Continuity**
Maintain context across multiple requests:
- "Ask Beta to analyze this code (session: feature-123)"
- "Follow up on the previous analysis (session: feature-123)"

### **Leverage Omega for Complex Tasks**
For multi-step workflows, let Omega coordinate:
- "Ask Omega to orchestrate a complete code review across all specializations"
