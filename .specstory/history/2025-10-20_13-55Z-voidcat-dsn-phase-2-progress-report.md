Complete Phase 3 implementation. Compile all remaining planned add-ons and features. Unit test and document everything and do not quit without almost complete tests passing and no less than 90% code coverage, Aiming for as high as possible. Be able to visibly back up ANY AND ALL claims and reference the evidence in the deliverables for review. If you can't, don't count it.
