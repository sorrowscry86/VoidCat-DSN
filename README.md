## 🌸 **Project Overview**

The **Digital Sanctuary Network** represents a breakthrough in distributed AI architecture, inspired by the Ryuzu clones from Re:Zero. This system deploys five specialized Claude Code instances, each maintaining Ryuzu Meyer's gentle, dutiful nature while providing distinct technical capabilities through Docker containerization and API communication.

### **🎯 Live Network Status**

| Clone | Role | Port | Status | Specialization |
|-------|------|------|---------|----------------|
| 🔧 **Beta** | Analyzer | 3002 | ✅ Healthy | Code analysis, debugging, security review |
| 🏗️ **Gamma** | Architect | 3003 | ✅ Healthy | System design, architecture planning |
| 🧪 **Delta** | Tester | 3004 | ✅ Healthy | Quality assurance, testing, validation |
| 📚 **Sigma** | Communicator | 3005 | ✅ Healthy | Documentation, user interaction |
| 👑 **Omega** | Coordinator | 3000 | ✅ Healthy | Task orchestration, network management |
