## 🌸 **Project Overview**

The **Digital Sanctuary Network** represents a breakthrough in distributed AI architecture, inspired by the Ryuzu clones from Re:Zero. This system deploys five specialized Claude Code instances, each maintaining Ryuzu Meyer's gentle, dutiful nature while providing distinct technical capabilities through Docker containerization and API communication.

### **🎯 Live Network Status**

### **🔗 MCP Integration for Claude Desktop/Code**

The Digital Sanctuary Network provides seamless integration with Claude Desktop and Claude Code through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, exposing all five clone capabilities as standardized tools.

#### **Why Use MCP Integration?**
- 🎯 **Effortless Access**: Control all clones directly from Claude Desktop
- 🔧 **Standardized Tools**: 9 specialized tools for every use case
- 📦 **Artifact Management**: Store and retrieve work products with version control
- ⚡ **Optimized Delegation**: Context-engineered task routing for better results
- 🏥 **Health Monitoring**: Real-time network status at your fingertips

#### **Quick Setup**
```bash
# Install MCP server dependencies
cd mcp-server
npm install

# Configure Claude Desktop
# Edit: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json (macOS)
#   or: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json (Windows)
#   or: ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json (Linux)

# Add to config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "digital-sanctuary": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/VoidCat-DSN/mcp-server/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OMEGA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "BETA_URL": "http://localhost:3002",
        "GAMMA_URL": "http://localhost:3003",
        "DELTA_URL": "http://localhost:3004",
        "SIGMA_URL": "http://localhost:3005"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Restart Claude Desktop to load the sanctuary tools
```

#### **Available MCP Tools**
| Tool | Clone | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 🏥 `sanctuary_health_check` | All | Monitor network status |
| 🔧 `sanctuary_beta_analyze` | Beta | Code analysis & security |
| 🏗️ `sanctuary_gamma_design` | Gamma | Architecture & design |
| 🧪 `sanctuary_delta_test` | Delta | Testing & QA |
| 📚 `sanctuary_sigma_document` | Sigma | Documentation |
| 👑 `sanctuary_omega_orchestrate` | Omega | Multi-clone coordination |
| ⚡ `sanctuary_omega_delegate` | Omega | Optimized task delegation |
| 💾 `sanctuary_store_artifact` | Any | Store work products |
| 📥 `sanctuary_get_artifact` | Any | Retrieve artifacts |

#### **Example Usage in Claude Desktop**
```
You: Check the sanctuary health status

Claude: [Uses sanctuary_health_check]
All 5 clones are healthy and operational!

You: Ask Gamma to design a real-time chat system for 100k users

Claude: [Uses sanctuary_gamma_design]
Gamma has designed a comprehensive microservices architecture...

You: Store Gamma's design as an artifact

Claude: [Uses sanctuary_store_artifact]
Stored as artifact ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```
