          -Destination "$env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json" -Force
```

**macOS**:
```bash
cp ~/Development/VoidCat-DSN/claude_desktop_config.json \
   ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Linux**:
```bash
cp ~/Development/VoidCat-DSN/claude_desktop_config.json \
   ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Step 2️⃣ Restart Claude (2 minutes)

1. Close Claude Desktop completely
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Reopen Claude Desktop
4. Wait 5 seconds for MCP to load

### Step 3️⃣ Verify Integration (1 minute)

Ask Claude in a chat:
```

## 🛠️ 9 Available MCP Tools

Once integrated with Claude, you have access to:

1. **sanctuary_health_check** - Check all clones operational status
2. **sanctuary_beta_analyze** - Security & code analysis
3. **sanctuary_gamma_design** - System architecture planning
4. **sanctuary_delta_test** - QA & testing strategies
5. **sanctuary_sigma_document** - Documentation generation
6. **sanctuary_omega_orchestrate** - Multi-clone coordination
7. **sanctuary_omega_delegate** - Smart task delegation
8. **sanctuary_store_artifact** - Version-controlled storage
9. **sanctuary_get_artifact** - Artifact retrieval

---

## ✨ Example Usage

### Ask Gamma to Design a System
```
"Design a scalable microservices architecture for a real-time chat platform"
```
Claude automatically routes to Gamma (architect clone) and returns comprehensive architecture design.

### Ask Beta to Analyze Code
```
"Analyze this code for security vulnerabilities: [your code]"
```
Claude routes to Beta (security analyzer) and returns detailed security analysis.

### Store & Retrieve Work
```
"Store this architecture design as an artifact"
```
Claude stores with SHA-256 checksum and returns artifact ID.

Later:
```
"Retrieve artifact [ID] and analyze for improvements"
```
Claude retrieves and performs fresh analysis.

## 🐳 Your Deployed Network

```
Port 3000  ← Omega (Coordinator)        ✅ HEALTHY
Port 3002  ← Beta (Analyzer)             ✅ HEALTHY
Port 3003  ← Gamma (Architect)           ✅ HEALTHY
Port 3004  ← Delta (Tester)              ✅ HEALTHY
Port 3005  ← Sigma (Communicator)        ✅ HEALTHY
```

All 5 clones are:
- Running on Docker
- Health checks enabled (30s intervals)
- Auto-recovery enabled
- Ready for requests

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Don't Appear
1. **Verify config file**: Check `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` exists
2. **Restart Claude**: Close completely, wait 5s, reopen
3. **Check Docker**: `docker ps` should show all 5 containers running

### Clones Not Responding
1. **Check status**: `docker ps --filter "name=ryuzu-"`
2. **Restart clone**: `docker restart ryuzu-beta-sanctuary`
3. **Check logs**: `docker logs ryuzu-beta-sanctuary --tail 20`

### Port Already in Use
1. **Find process**: `netstat -ano | findstr ":3000"` (Windows)
2. **Stop service**: Kill the conflicting process
3. **Restart clone**: `docker restart ryuzu-omega-sanctuary`

## 💡 Pro Tips

✨ **Tip 1**: Each clone is independent. You can restart one without affecting others.

✨ **Tip 2**: Use Omega for complex workflows involving multiple clones.

✨ **Tip 3**: Store important work as artifacts for version control and easy access.

✨ **Tip 4**: Health checks run every 30 seconds. Clones auto-recover from failures.

✨ **Tip 5**: All inter-clone communication is HTTP JSON - easy to debug with curl.
