   2. Restart Claude Desktop (2 minutes)
      - Close Claude completely
      - Wait 5 seconds
      - Reopen Claude
      - Wait 5 seconds for MCP to load
      
   3. Verify Integration (1 minute)
      Ask Claude: "Check the Digital Sanctuary Network health status"
      Expected: All 5 clones reporting HEALTHY ✅
